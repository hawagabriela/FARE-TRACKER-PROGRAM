# Programming & Computing Ethics – Fare Tracker Program

We created the Fare Tracker program following ethical practices:
- All the code in this project was written by us, and we did not copy from anyone.  
- We made sure the program respects user privacy. It does not share or save any personal data online.  
- The program is designed to be simple and easy for anyone to use, even if they are not familiar with programming.  
- We tried to follow the ACM code of ethics, including being honest, fair, and respectful to users while building this program.
