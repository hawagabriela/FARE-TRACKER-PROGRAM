# FARE-TRACKER-PROGRAM

## Description
This is a simple Python program that helps users record and manage their transportation expenses. Users can add fares by entering the date, type of transport, and fare amount. The program allows users to view all recorded fares in a clear and organized table. It can also calculate the total money spent on transportation so users can keep track of their expenses. The menu is easy to use and runs continuously until the user decides to exit, making it simple and interactive for everyone.
