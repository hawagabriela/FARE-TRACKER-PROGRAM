# FARE-TRACKER-PROGRAM

## Description
This is a simple Python program that helps users keep track of their transport expenses. Users can add fares by entering the date, type of transport, and fare amount. After adding a fare, the program shows a small receipt with the details. It also checks if the weekly budget is passed and gives a warning if it is. Users can see all fares in a clear table and check the total money spent. The menu is easy to use and stays open until the user chooses to exit, making it simple and easy for everyone.

## Problem Statement + Objectives
People spend money on transport every day but often forget how much they spent. This makes it hard to know the total cost. Our program helps users write down their fares, see all expenses, and know the total spent. It is easy to use and helps manage transport money better.
